# football
On this page is a collection of football related data files and presentations.

I plan for my work on home and away fan numbers modelling to be housed here. For now, you can look at a presentation (where the links in the slides don't work if viewed on here I'm afraid) [here](syracuse-slides-2025-03-05.pdf)

Eventually more data files from that project will be posted here, as will an app to present forecasts (and historical fitted values) from the model itself.
