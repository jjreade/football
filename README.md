# football
On this page is a collection of football related data files and presentations.

I plan for my work on home and away fan numbers modelling to be housed here. For now, you can look at a presentation (where the links in the slides don't work if viewed on here I'm afraid) [here](syracuse-slides-2025-03-05.pdf)

Eventually more data files from that project will be posted here, including the data itself with away fan numbers collected from various sources over the years. A working paper, with the method for the forecasting model, will also be shared shortly.

I have now created a web app that allows the user to look at their team (if their team is in one of the top 5 leagues in England) and look at past matches and attendances, as well as future ones. If you're interested, click [here](https://home-and-away-fan-forecasts.streamlit.app/).
